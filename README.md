Learning Domain Open Toolkit 1.x Plugins
=========================

Open Toolkit plugins for the DITA learning and learing2 domains. For use with the 1.x Open Toolkit

This project is a convenience for packaging the four plugins required for full HTML and PDF support for the DITA learning and learning2 domains (interactions or questions and answers).

This project uses the four plugins as Git submodules. If you clone this repository you will need to initialize and update the submodules:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    
This same functionality will be integrated with the 2.0 Open Toolkit out of the box.

The submodules are:
